            <h2>What We Do</h2>
            <p>At Smile for Life, our Community Education program serves as the foundation of our fight against oral cancer. We design and deliver interactive health education initiatives focused on increasing awareness of oral cancer prevention, early signs, risk factors, and treatment options. Our goal is to empower people of all age groups‚Äîespecially those in underserved communities‚Äîwith the knowledge and tools they need to take control of their oral health.</p>
             
            <h2>Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>Oral cancer remains a silent killer in many communities due to limited awareness, late diagnosis, and poor access to healthcare. In Rwanda and other low-resource settings, many individuals are unaware of the early warning signs or the importance of regular screening.</p>

            <p><strong>By prioritizing education, we aim to:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Break myths and misinformation surrounding oral cancer</li>
                <li>Promote preventive behaviors like good oral hygiene and avoiding tobacco or alcohol</li>
                <li>Encourage early reporting of suspicious symptoms</li>
                <li>Reduce stigma and increase access to care</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We believe that an informed community is a protected community‚Äîand education is the first step toward saving lives.</p>


            <h2>How We Do It</h2>

        <div class="content-section">
            <img src="early1.jpg" alt="Early Screening">

            <h2>Why Early Screening Matters</h2>

            <p>Oral cancer is highly treatable when detected early, yet in Rwanda and across many African countries, the vast majority of cases are diagnosed at advanced stages‚Äîwhen options are limited, costs are high, and survival rates drop dramatically.</p>

            <p>At Smile for Life, we believe that every delay in diagnosis costs more than time‚Äîit costs lives.</p>

            <p>Through our Early Screening & Diagnosis Program, we bring life-saving diagnostic services directly to the people‚Äîespecially those in underserved schools, rural areas, and vulnerable communities. We bridge the gap between symptom and solution, empowering individuals to seek care before it's too late.</p>

            <h2>What We Do</h2>

            <p>Our program provides free, accessible, and regular oral cancer screening services through community-based outreach and mobile clinics. We work with trained healthcare professionals to perform non-invasive, fast, and safe oral examinations, focused on detecting early warning signs such as:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Non-healing mouth ulcers</li>
                <li>Persistent swelling or lumps</li>
                <li>Red or white patches</li>
                <li>Pain, numbness, or difficulty chewing or swallowing</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Once a potential case is identified, we support patients in accessing referral systems, diagnostic testing, and specialist care through our trusted partners and health facilities.</p>

            <h2>How We Deliver Impact:</h2>

            <h2>üë©üèΩ‚Äç‚öï On-site Screening Campaigns</h2>
            <p>We organize mass screening events during national health days, and community festivals to maximize reach and visibility.</p>

            <h2>ü§ù Collaborative Diagnosis Pathways</h2>
            <p>We work with local clinics, dental professionals, and hospitals to ensure timely diagnosis, follow-up care, and counseling for patients in need.</p>

            <h2>üß† Beyond Screening‚ÄîBuilding Trust</h2>
            <p>Screening is not just about exams‚Äîit's about trust, dignity, and accessibility. Many people fear cancer diagnoses due to stigma, cost, and misinformation. That‚Äôs why we combine screenings with education, engaging individuals before and after the check-up to demystify the process, explain results, and encourage follow-up.</p>

            <h2>üõë The Cost of Inaction</h2>
            <p>Without early screening:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Patients only seek help when cancer is painful and advanced</li>
                <li>Families spend months in hospitals, facing trauma and financial ruin</li>
                <li>Lives are lost that could have been saved with a 5-minute check</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>üåç Our Promise</h2>
            <P>We will not wait for people to come to us‚Äîwe will go to them.</P>
            <p>We will not allow fear or poverty to delay diagnosis.</p>
            <p>We will not stop until every person, in every village, knows that oral cancer can be found‚Äîand beaten‚Äîearly.</p>

            <p> Because prevention isn't expensive. But silence is.</p>

            <h2>Why Training Matters</h2>
                    <p>Ending the oral cancer crisis in Rwanda requires more than awareness‚Äîit requires a skilled, confident, and empowered health workforce. At Smile for Life, we believe that the first line of defense against oral cancer isn't just a doctor‚Äîit's every teacher, nurse, community health worker, and student equipped with the right knowledge and tools.</p>
                    
                    <p>In a country where specialized dental care is scarce, training is our most powerful tool for sustainability. When we train one person, we empower them to protect hundreds of lives in their community.</p>

                    <p>Without trained professionals:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Early signs of oral cancer are missed at the primary care level</li>
                        <li>Communities rely on guesswork or myths, not science</li>
                        <li>There's no continuity of care beyond awareness campaigns</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Training solves this by embedding knowledge within the community and within the health system‚Äîso the work continues long after the campaign ends.</p>


                    <h2>üåç Our Commitment</h2>

    <!-- PROBLEM DESCRIPTION PAGE -->
    <div id="problem" class="page">
        <div class="page-header">
            <h1>üö® Problem Description: The Silent Crisis of Oral Cancer</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content-section">
            <p>Oral cancer is one of the most overlooked health threats in low- and middle-income countries, including Rwanda. While largely preventable and treatable when detected early, oral cancer continues to claim lives‚Äînot because of medical complexity, but because of silence, stigma, and systemic neglect.</p>

            <p>Despite growing global awareness of non-communicable diseases, oral cancer remains buried beneath layers of misinformation, limited access to dental care, cultural taboos, and a critical shortage of early screening programs. In Rwanda, many individuals only seek help when the disease has already progressed to advanced stages‚Äîwhen treatment options are few, outcomes are poor, and hope fades.</p>

            <h2>üîç The Root of the Problem</h2>

            <h2>1. Lack of Awareness</h2>
            <p>Most people do not recognize the early signs of oral cancer, such as persistent mouth sores, lumps, or bleeding.</p>
            <p>There is a widespread lack of knowledge about the risk factors: tobacco use, alcohol consumption, poor oral hygiene, HPV, and certain dietary practices.</p>
            <p>Stigma and fear prevent people from seeking timely medical attention.</p>


            <h2>2. Late Diagnosis</h2>
            <p>In rural areas and underserved urban communities, oral cancer is often diagnosed too late, reducing survival rates and increasing suffering.</p>
            <p>Limited access to trained professionals, diagnostic tools, and screening centers leads to critical delays.</p>

            
            <h2>3. Insufficient Education and Outreach</h2>
            <p>Oral health education is rarely included in public health campaigns, school curricula, or community programs.</p>
            <p>Preventive dental care is often unavailable or unaffordable, especially for low-income populations.</p>



            <h2>4.Why This Problem Must Be Solved</h2>
            <p>Oral cancer is not just a medical issue‚Äîit's a social justice issue. It exposes inequalities in access, education, and care. And it disproportionately affects those who are already vulnerable.</p>
            <p>Smile for Life was born to break this silence.</p>
            <p>We believe that no one should die from a disease they didn't know existed, and no one should suffer in silence when prevention and early detection can save lives.</p>
            <p>Our work is not just about treating illness‚Äîit's about restoring dignity, saving families, empowering communities, and building a future where awareness, access, and action eliminate oral cancer as a threat to public health.</p>


            <h2>5.üö® A Call to Action</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Educate people in every corner of Rwanda about oral cancer</li>
                <li>Train healthcare workers to detect early signs</li>
                <li>Integrate oral health into national public health priorities</li>
                <li>Empower communities to speak out, screen early, and act fast</li>
            </ul>


            <h2>SUMMARY</h2>
            <P>Oral cancer may be silent‚Äîbut we will not be.
            Through education, detection, and compassion, we are turning pain into purpose, fear into action, and silence into survival.</P>
